What is Sql?

Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational database. A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. You can use SQL statements to store, update, remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.

Sql Important -
Structured query language (SQL) is a popular query language that is frequently used in all types of applications. Data analysts and developers learn and use SQL because it integrates well with different programming languages. For example, they can embed SQL queries with the Java programming language to build high-performing data processing applications with major SQL database systems such as Oracle or MS SQL Server. SQL is also fairly easy to learn as it uses common English keywords in its statements

SQL statements
SQL statements, or SQL queries, are valid instructions that relational database management systems understand. Software developers build SQL statements by using different SQL language elements. SQL language elements are components such as identifiers, variables, and search conditions that form a correct SQL statement.

For example, the following SQL statement uses a SQL INSERT command to store Mattress Brand A, priced $499, into a table named Mattress_table, with column names brand_name and cost:

INSERT INTO Mattress_table (brand_name, cost)

VALUES(‘A’,’499’);


What is NoSQL?
NoSQL refers to non-relational databases that don't use tables to store data. Developers store information in different types of NoSQL databases, including graphs, documents, and key-values. NoSQL databases are popular for modern applications because they are horizontally scalable. Horizontal scaling means increasing the processing power by adding more computers that run NoSQL software.
